#' Calculate weighted or unweighted (Fast) Unifrac distance
#'
#' This function calculates the Unifrac distance for all sample-pairs
#' in a \code{\link[TreeSummarizedExperiment:TreeSummarizedExperiment-class]{TreeSummarizedExperiment}}
#' object. The function utilizes \code{\link[rbiom:unifrac]{rbiom:unifrac()}}.
#'
#' Please note that if \code{calculateUnifrac} is used as a \code{FUN} for
#' \code{runMDS}, the argument \code{ntop} has to be set to \code{nrow(x)}.
#'
#' @param x a numeric matrix or a
#'   \code{\link[TreeSummarizedExperiment:TreeSummarizedExperiment-class]{TreeSummarizedExperiment}}
#'   object containing a tree.
#'
#'   Please  note that \code{runUnifrac} expects a matrix with samples per row
#'   and not per column. This is implemented to be compatible with other
#'   distance calculations such as \code{\link[stats:dist]{dist}} as much as
#'   possible.
#'
#' @param tree if \code{x} is a matrix, a
#'   \code{\link[TreeSummarizedExperiment:phylo]{phylo}} object matching the
#'   matrix. This means that the phylo object and the columns should relate
#'   to the same type of features (aka. microorganisms).
#'   
#' @param nodeLab if \code{x} is a matrix, 
#'   a \code{character} vector specifying links between rows/columns and tips of \code{tree}.
#'   The length must equal the number of rows/columns of \code{x}. Furthermore, all the 
#'   node labs must be present in \code{tree}.
#'
#' @param assay.type a single \code{character} value for specifying which
#'   assay to use for calculation.
#'   
#' @param exprs_values a single \code{character} value for specifying which
#'   assay to use for calculation.
#'   (Please use \code{assay.type} instead.)
#'   
#' @param assay_name a single \code{character} value for specifying which
#'   assay to use for calculation.
#'   (Please use \code{assay.type} instead. At some point \code{assay_name}
#'   will be disabled.)
#'
#' @param tree_name a single \code{character} value for specifying which
#'   tree will be used in calculation. 
#'   (By default: \code{tree_name = "phylo"})
#'   
#' @param weighted \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}: Should use weighted-Unifrac
#'   calculation? Weighted-Unifrac takes into account the relative abundance of
#'   species/taxa shared between samples, whereas unweighted-Unifrac only
#'   considers presence/absence. Default is \code{FALSE}, meaning the
#'   unweighted-Unifrac distance is calculated for all pairs of samples.
#'
#' @param transposed Logical scalar, is x transposed with cells in rows, i.e., 
#'   is Unifrac distance calculated based on rows (FALSE) or columns (TRUE).
#'   (By default: \code{transposed = FALSE})
#'   
#' @param ... optional arguments not used.
#'
#' @return a sample-by-sample distance matrix, suitable for NMDS, etc.
