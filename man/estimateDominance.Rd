\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{assay}}
to use for prevalence calculation.}

\item{index}{Specifies the indices which are calculated.}

\code{estimateDominance} calculates the community dominance indices.
\itemize{
\item{'DBP' }{Berger-Parker index is calculated similarly than relative index.
DBP is the relative abundance of the most abundant species of the sample.
($N_1/N_tot$, where $N_1$ is the absolute abundance of the most dominant species and
$N_tot$ is the sum of absolute abundances of all species.) Index gives values in interval \link{0,1},
where bigger value represent greater dominance. (Maiti 2012 p. 29.)}
\item{'DMN' }{McNaughtonâ€™s index is the sum of relative abundances of the two most
abundant species of the sample. ($(N_1+N_2)/N_tot$, where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the absolute
abundances of the two most dominant species and $N_tot$ is the sum of absolute
abundances of all species.) Index gives values in interval \link{0,1},
where bigger value represent greater dominance.}
\item{'absolute' }{Absolute index equals to the absolute abundance of the most
dominant species of the sample. Index gives positive integer values.}
\item{'relative' }{Relative index equals to the relative abundance of the most
dominant species of the sample. ($N_1/N_tot$, where $N_1$ is the absolute abundance of
the most dominant species and $N_tot$ is the sum of absolute abundances of all species.)
Index gives values in interval \link{0,1}, where bigger value represent greater dominance.}
\item{'simpson' }{Simpson's index, or Simpson's dominance index, is calculated
by raising all relative abundances of species to the power of 2, and then summing them together.
($sum(p^2)$, where $p$ is relative abundances.) Index gives values in interval \link{0,1}.
Value equals the probability that two randomly chosen individuals belongs to the same species.
The higher the probability, the greater the dominance is. (Thukral et al. 2019.)}
\item{'core_abundance' }{Core abundance index is related to core species.
Core species are species that are most abundant in all samples, i.e., in whole data set.
Core species are defined as those species that have prevalence over 50\\%.
It means that in order to belong to core species, species must be prevalent in 50\\% of samples.
Core species are used to calculate the core abundance index.
Core abundance index is sum of relative abundances of core species in the sample.
($N_core/N_tot$, where $N_core$ is the sum of absolute abundance of the core species and
$N_tot$ is the sum of absolute abundances of all species.) Index gives values in interval \link{0,1},
where bigger value represent greater dominance.}
\item{'gini' }{Gini index is probably best-known from economical relations.
In economics, it is used to measure, for example, how unevenly wealth
is distributed among population. Here, Gini index is used similarly, but wealth
is replaced with abundance. If there is small group of species that represent
large portion of total abundance of microbes, the inequality is large and
Gini index closer to 1. If all species has equally large abundances, the equality
is perfect and Gini index equals 0. (Sitthiyot & Holasut 2020.)}
