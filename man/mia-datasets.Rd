\description{
These datasets are conversions of the \pkg{phyloseq} datasets
\code{GlobalPatterns}, \code{enterotype}, and \code{esophagus} into the
\link[TreeSummarizedExperiment:TreeSummarizedExperiment-class]{TreeSummarizedExperiment}
data container.

\code{dmn_se} contains an example \code{SummarizedExperiment} derived
from data in the \pkg{DirichletMultinomial} package. See
\code{?calculateDMN} for more details.

Global patterns of 16S rRNA diversity at a depth of millions of sequences per sample (2011)

This work compared the microbial communities from 25 environmental samples and three known ``mock communities''
at a an averag depth of 3.1 million reads per sample.
Authors reproduced diversity patterns seen in many other
published studies, while invesitigating technical issues/bias by
applying the same techniques to simulated microbial communities of known
composition. Many thanks to J. Gregory Caporaso for providing the OTU-clustered data files
for inclusion in the \pkg{phyloseq} package, from which this data \code{TreeSummarizedExperiment}
version was then converted.

The enterotype data of the human gut microbiome (Arumugam et al. 2011) includes
taxonomic profiling for 280 fecal samples from 22 subjects based on shotgun DNA sequencing.
The authors claimed that the data naturally clumps into three community-level clusters, or
``enterotypes'', that are not immediately explained by sequencing technology or demographic
features of the subjects. A later addendum (2014) the authors stated that enterotypes
"should not be seen as discrete clusters, but as a way of stratifying samples to reduce complexity."

The esophagus data set from Pei et al. (2004)
includes 3 samples from 3 human adults based on biopsies analysed with 16S rDNA PCR.
The 16S rRNA sequence processing has been provided in the mothur wiki
at the link below.

This data set from Turnbaugh et al. (2009) was used to introduce
Dirichlet Multinomial Mixtures (DMM) for microbiota stratification by
Holmes et al. (2012).
