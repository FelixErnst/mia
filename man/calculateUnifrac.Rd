\usage{
calculateUnifrac(x, tree, ...)

\S4method{calculateUnifrac}{ANY,phylo}(x, tree, weighted = FALSE, ...)

\S4method{calculateUnifrac}{TreeSummarizedExperiment,missing}(
  x,
  assay.type = assay_name,
  assay_name = exprs_values,
  exprs_values = "counts",
  tree_name = "phylo",
  transposed = FALSE,
  ...
)

runUnifrac(x, tree, weighted = FALSE, nodeLab = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric matrix or a
\code{\link[TreeSummarizedExperiment:TreeSummarizedExperiment-class]{TreeSummarizedExperiment}}
object containing a tree.

Please  note that \code{runUnifrac} expects a matrix with samples per row
and not per column. This is implemented to be compatible with other
distance calculations such as \code{\link[stats:dist]{dist}} as much as
possible.}

\item{tree}{if \code{x} is a matrix, a
\code{\link[TreeSummarizedExperiment:phylo]{phylo}} object matching the
matrix. This means that the phylo object and the columns should relate
to the same type of features (aka. microorganisms).}

\item{...}{optional arguments not used.}

\item{weighted}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}: Should use weighted-Unifrac
calculation? Weighted-Unifrac takes into account the relative abundance of
species/taxa shared between samples, whereas unweighted-Unifrac only
considers presence/absence. Default is \code{FALSE}, meaning the
unweighted-Unifrac distance is calculated for all pairs of samples.}

\item{assay.type}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
assay to use for calculation.}

\item{assay_name}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
assay to use for calculation.
(Please use \code{assay.type} instead. At some point \code{assay_name}
will be disabled.)}

\item{exprs_values}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
assay to use for calculation.
(Please use \code{assay.type} instead.)}

\item{tree_name}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
tree will be used in calculation.
(By default: \code{tree_name = "phylo"})}

\item{transposed}{Logical scalar, is x transposed with cells in rows, i.e.,
is Unifrac distance calculated based on rows (FALSE) or columns (TRUE).
(By default: \code{transposed = FALSE})}

\item{nodeLab}{if \code{x} is a matrix,
a \code{character} vector specifying links between rows/columns and tips of \code{tree}.
The length must equal the number of rows/columns of \code{x}. Furthermore, all the
node labs must be present in \code{tree}.}
}
\value{
a sample-by-sample distance matrix, suitable for NMDS, etc.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Unifrac distance for all sample-pairs
in a \code{\link[TreeSummarizedExperiment:TreeSummarizedExperiment-class]{TreeSummarizedExperiment}}
object. The function utilizes \code{\link[rbiom:unifrac]{rbiom:unifrac()}}.
}
\details{
Please note that if \code{calculateUnifrac} is used as a \code{FUN} for
\code{runMDS}, the argument \code{ntop} has to be set to \code{nrow(x)}.
}
\examples{
data(esophagus)
library(scater)
calculateUnifrac(esophagus, weighted = FALSE)
calculateUnifrac(esophagus, weighted = TRUE)
# for using calculateUnifrac in conjunction with runMDS the tree argument
# has to be given separately. In addition, subsetting using ntop must
# be disabled
esophagus <- runMDS(esophagus, FUN = calculateUnifrac, name = "Unifrac",
                    tree = rowTree(esophagus),
                    assay.type = "counts",
                    ntop = nrow(esophagus))
