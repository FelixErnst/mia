\arguments{
\item{x}{a
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}}
object containing a tree.}

\item{assay.type}{A single character value for selecting the
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{assay}}
to calculate the overlap.}

\item{assay_name}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
assay to use for calculation.
(Please use \code{assay.type} instead. At some point \code{assay_name}
will be disabled.)}

\item{detection}{A single numeric value for selecting detection threshold for
absence/presence of features. Feature that has abundance under threshold in
either of samples, will be discarded when evaluating overlap between samples.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments not used.}

\item{name}{A single character value specifying the name of overlap matrix that
is stored in reducedDim(x).}
}
\value{
getOverlap returns sample-by-sample distance matrix.
addOverlap returns \code{x} that includes overlap matrix in its
reducedDim.
}
\description{
This function calculates overlap for all sample-pairs
in a \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}}
object.
}
\details{
These function calculates overlap between all the sample-pairs. Overlap
reflects similarity between sample-pairs.

When overlap is calculated using relative abundances, the higher the value the
higher the similarity is, When using relative abundances, overlap value 1 means that
all the abundances of features are equal between two samples, and 0 means that
samples have completely different relative abundances.
