Changes in version 0.99.0
+ Submitted to Bioconductor

Changes in version 1.1.x
+ split transformCounts into transformSamples and transformFeatures
+ added log_modulo_skewness as a diversity index
+ added functions for summarizing dominant taxa information
+ added wrapper for adding dominant taxa information to colData
+ added specialized subsetting function for subsetting by prevalence (subsetByPrevalentTaxa/subsetByRareTaxa)
+ added mapTaxonomy
+ added estimateDivergence
+ bugfix: makePhyloseqFromTreeSummarizedExperiment checks now for rowTree be compatible
+ bugfix: meltAssay supports Matrix types
+ bugfix: meltAssay is able to include rowData also when there are duplicated rownames
+ added subsampleCounts for Subsampling/Rarefying data
+ added getExperimentCrossCorrelation for calculatting cross-correlation between features
+ added calculateOverlap
+ getUniqueTaxa & getTopTaxa: added option for alphabetical order

Changes in version 1.3.x 
+ name change: testForExperimentCrossCorrelation to testExperimentCrossCorrelation
+ getExperimentCrossCorrelation: Filtering disabled by default, option to suppress warnings
+ bugfix: taxonomyTree gave error if taxa were agglomerated at highest level (taxa name mismatch)
+ bugfix: subsampleCounts errors if no samples are found after subsampling
+ added loadFromMetaphlan
+ renamed calculateUniFrac to calculateUnifrac 
+ bugfix: makeTreeSEFromPseq -- orientation of assay is taken into account
